            <h2>Integrity</h2>
            <p>Integrity is maintained in the intactness of tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the whole Taj Mahal
                complex. The physical fabric is in good condition and structural stability, nature of foundation,
                verticality of the minarets and other constructional aspects of Taj Mahal have been studied and continue
                to be monitored. To control the impact of deterioration due for atmospheric pollutants, an air control
                monitoring station is installed to constantly monitor air quality and control decay factors as they
                arise. To ensure the protection of the setting, the adequate management and enforcement of regulations
                in the extended buffer zone is needed. In addition, future development for tourist facilities will need
                to ensure that the functional and visual integrity of the property is maintained, particularly in the
                relationship with the Agra Fort.</p>

            <h2 style="color: black;">Brief Synthesis</h2>
            <p style="color: black;"> The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses
                nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in
                memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the
                mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were
                added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic
                inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its
                construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other
                artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran.
                Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.

                The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of
                Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and
                voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic
                aspect. The colour combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the
                monument in ever changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi
                precious stones make it a monument apart. </p>
